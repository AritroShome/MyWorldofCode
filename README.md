# MyWorldofCode
Seeing the world through the eyes of a teen in love with code.
My name is Aritro Shome.
I am 14 years of age and the pulchritude of coding has been an appaling
factor for me since quite a few years. I explore simple thoughts through code and 
am using and learning a language called JAVA.
